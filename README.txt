Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Python 3.x
Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Libraries: pandas,numpy,sklearn,matplotlib,seaborn, xgboost

To install the necessary libraries, open your command line interface and execute the following commands:
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
pip install xgboost


The dataset is present in this zip folder itself.

Execution Instructions:

Open the Notebook: Launch the Jupyter Notebook and open the file "code.ipynb"
Run the Notebook: Execute the notebook by using the “Run” button in the toolbar.

NOTE:
The device used to run and train the model has lower specifications than the latest laptops or desktops, thus it takes approximately 2 hours to run the entire code. Also, the dataset is rather large, and computing it with three distinct models takes time. As a result, the worst-case execution time is two (or three) hours. If your device includes a GPU, the time may be reduced even further.
